// Package responses implements a minimal client for the OpenAI responses API.
//
// This is primarily meant for my own use and is not intended to be a "complete" or
// "production-ready" implementation. I just didn't want to wait until an officially
// supported Go SDK was available. Hopefully that will happen soon.
//
// Crafted by hand from the OpenAI API documentation, with a little bit
// of help from GitHub Copilot and JSON-to-Go generators.
